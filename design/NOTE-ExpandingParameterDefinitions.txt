NOTE on expanding model dimensions for parameter definitions

Model dimensions relevant to a parameter definition can be specified in the following manners:
1. by individual dimension level or vector of levels (e.g., "male", "female" for `x` [sex], (2020:2024) for `y` [year])
2. "all"
3. absent (equivalent to "all")
4. "each"

How should these be handled when expanding a parameter definition?
MPs: main parameters
indiv: parameter (value/characteristics) assigned to to specified level of model dimension
"all": expands same parameter (value/characteristics) to all levels of model dimension
"each": (not implemented yet) expands same INITIAL VALUE and characteristics to each level of a model dimension,
           but each level will be treated as a different parameter under estimation (shorthand for individual specification)
Individual "parameters" are created based on the "union" of the dimension levels resulting from specifying any of the above
for combiniations of dimension levels.

OPs: offset parameters
same as for MPs

DPs: devs parameter vectors


REs: random effects vectors

PECs: parameter-level environmental covariates

FECs: function-level environmental covariates
