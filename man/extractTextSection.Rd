\description{
Function to extract a text section with only non-comment lines from a character vector.
}
\details{
Each element in \code{txt} is regarded as a line of text (as in a text file).
The function searches for the first \code{n} non-comment lines and extracts them as a new vector.
The returned list has elements
\itemize{
\item{txt - character vector of length \code{n} with comment lines removed (i.e., a subset of \code{txt})}
\item{end - index of the last element extracted in the input \code{txt} vector}
}
}
