\description{
Function to a dataframe (a \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}}) from a character vector.
}
\details{
Each element in \code{txt} is regarded as a line of text (as in a text file).
The dataframe structure and column types are determined by \code{\link[readr:read_table]{readr::read_table()}}.
\itemize{
\item{txt - character vector of length \code{n} with comment lines removed (i.e., a subset of \code{txt})}
\item{end - index of the last element extracted in the input \code{txt} vector}
}
}
