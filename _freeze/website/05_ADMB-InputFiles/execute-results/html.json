As discussed below, these files can be read using functions available in the rtmbGMACS package, simplifying conversion of models from ADMB to RTMB.\n\n### The \"gmacs.dat\" file\n\nA ADMB \"gmacs.dat\" can be read using the `readADMB_DatFile` function. This file specifies the filenames of the dat, ctl, and prj files for a model run, as well as other information such as stock name, units of weight and abundance, and various options for running the ADMB model. The `readADMB_DatFile` function returns the information from this file as a named list, with elements \n\n  * `input files`: a character vector with the path/filenames for the \"dat\", \"ctl\", and \"prj\" files\n  * `units`: a named character vector specifying units for biomass (`wgt`) and abundance (`num`)\n  * `stock`: the name of the crab stock\n  * `jitter info`: a numeric vector with elements\n    - (1): a flag indicating whether (1) or not (0) to jitter the initial parameter values\n    - (2): the standard deviation for the jitter randomization\n  * `variances to export`: a numeric vector with values indicating whether (1) or not (0) to include uncertainty estimates for\n    - reference points\n    - recruits\n    - SSB\n    - Fbar: mean F\n    - OutDynB0: dynamic B0 output\n  * `retro peel`: the number of years to \"peel back\" the model end year for a retrospective model run\n  * `other`: a named list with elements specifying other options for the model run\n\nThe returned list has a \"type\" attribute set to \"admb dat file inputs\".\n\n### The \"dat\" file\n\nThe ADMB \"dat\" file includes all the data to be included in an ADMB gmacs model run. The ADMB version of gmacs is capable of including the following data types in the model optimization:\n\n  - fishery catch and effort time series data\n  - index (survey or fishery cpue) biomass and abundance time series data\n  - size composition data\n  - growth (molt increment) data\n  - maturity ogive data\n  - tagging data (for growth)\n  - environmental data time series\n  \nData files created for the ADMB version of gmacs can be read using the package function \n`readADMB_DataFile`. The result is a named list of dataframes (tibbles, actually) representing the input data. Elements include\n\n  * dfrCD: dataframe with all fishery catch time series data\n  * dfrID: dataframe with all index time series data\n  * dfrZCD: dataframe with all size comps data\n  * dfrGrD: dataframe with all growth data\n  * dfrMOD: dataframe with all maturity ogive data\n  * dfrTD: dataframe with all tagging data\n  * dfrED: dataframe with all environmental data time series\n  * effort data?? <-TODO\n\nThe returned list has a \"type\" attribute set to \"admb input data list\".\n\n### The \"ctl\" file\n\nThe ADMB \"ctl\" file describes the model parameterization, allowing the user to choose \nfunctions to describe model processes, specify which parameters are estimated or fixed, \nassign time blocks and priors, and define random walk behavior or environmental covariate structure. \nA function to convert the ADMB gmacs parameterization to an equivalent rtmbGMACS parameterization will \nbe developed in the future.\n\n### The \"prj\" file\n\nThe ADMB \"prj\" file describes how projections (if any) should be conducted after a model has been optimized. the \n`readADMB_PrjFile` function can be used to read \"prj\" files and returns a named list with elements \n\n  * optMSY: integer flag indicating whether to use MSY or an MSY proxy\n  * dfrOptsFixedF: dataframe indicating which fleets have F's fixed for the OFL calculations\n  * dfrOptsTBs: dataframe with time blocks for the OFL calculations\n  * dfrOptsOFL: dataframe with the OFL calculation options\n  * dfrOptsPrj: dataframe with the projection options\n  * dfrOptsHSs: dataframe with the state harvest strategy options\n  * optMaxMCMC: max number of MCMC draws\n  * optFullDiagnostics: flag to print full diagnostics\n\nThe returned list has a \"type\" attribute set to \"admb prj file inputs\".\n",
