Typical population categories might be sex and size, but it is possible to define a model with up to six categories, including region, sex, maturity state, age, post-molt age, and size. Although crustaceans cannot typically be aged, age (and post-molt age) can be included as a population category if population processes such as maturation or natural mortality are thought to have a strong age dependence.\n\nPopulation abundance in GMACS is represented as vector, $\\mathbf{n}$, with elements $n_c$, where $c$ is a 1-dimensional index across the combination of population categories. The temporal nature of the population is represented by $\\mathbf{n}(t)$, a vector representing the abundance in each category at time $t$ (i.e., a vector with elements $n_c(t)$).\n\nHeuristically, the population is integrated through time based on the following differential equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{n}}{dt} = \\left[ \\mathbf{T}(t)-(\\mathbf{M}(t)+\\mathbf{F}(t)) \\right]*\\mathbf{n}(t) + \\mathbf{R}(t) $$ {#eq-1}\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ is a $c$ x $c$ matrix representing transition rates between population categories (e.g., growth or movement) at time $t$, $\\mathbf{M}(t)$ is a similarly-sized diagonal matrix representing natural mortality at time $t$, $\\mathbf{F}(t)$ is a similarly-sized diagonal matrix representing fishing mortality at time $t$, and $\\mathbf{R}(t)$ is a $c$ x 1 vector representing the rate of recruitment at time $t$ of new crab into each population category. \n\nAssuming the rates in eq. {-eq-1} are constant across a timestep $\\delta t$, eq. [-@eq-1] can be integrated to obtain\n\n$$\\mathbf{n}_{t+\\delta t} = e^{\\mathbf{A}_t \\delta t_s}*\\mathbf{n}_t + \\mathbf{R}_t \\cdot \\delta t$$ {#eq-2}\n \nwhere $\\mathbf{A}_t=\\left[ \\mathbf{T}_t-(\\mathbf{M}_t+\\mathbf{F}_t) \\right]$. To meet the assumption of constant rates across the integration time step $\\delta t$, the In practice, when $\\mathbf{T}_t$ represents growth processes, these are regarded as discrete-time processes with a season length of zero, so that \n\n$$ \\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{T}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_t $$ {#eq-3}\n \nfor seasons in which growth occurs and \n\n$$ \\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = e^{-\\left[ \\mathbf{M}_t+\\mathbf{F}_t \\right]\\cdot \\delta t} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_t$$ {#eq-4}\n\nfor seasons with non-zero lengths in which mortality occurs.\n\nRecruitment, the addition of new individuals to the model population categories, is also considered a discrete-time process associated with a season of zero length, so \n\n$$ \\mathbf{n_{t+1}} = \\mathbf{r}_t+\\mathbf{n}_t $$ {#eq-5}\n\nwhen recruitment occurs, where $\\mathbf{r}_t$ is a vector of length $c$.\n\nAt an annual time step $y$, the integration across $n_s$ seasons $s$ can be represented as \n\n$$ \\mathbf{n}_{y+1,s=1} = \\{ \\prod_{s \\in {s_a}} \\mathbf{\\Lambda}_{y,s} \\} \\cdot \\{ \\mathbf{r}_y + \\cdot \\{ \\prod_{s \\in {s_b}} \\mathbf{\\Lambda}_{y,s} \\} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{y,s=1} \\}$$ {#eq-6}\n\nwhere $s_a$ are seasons after recruitment occurs and $s_b$ are seasons before recruitment occurs. This can be represented more compactly as \n\n$$ \\mathbf{n_{y+1}} = \\mathfrak{\\mathbf{A}}_y \\cdot \\{\\mathbf{r}_y + \\mathfrak{\\mathbf{B}}_y \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_y \\}$$ {#eq-7}\n\nwhere the season subscript has been dropped ($s=1$) from the $\\mathbf{n}$'s. \n\nAssuming that the terms in @eq-7 can be replaced by equilibrium equivalents (e.g., appropriate longterm averages), the equilibrium population size structure $<\\mathbf{n}>$ is given by \n\n$$ <\\mathbf{n}> = [<\\mathfrak{\\mathbf{A}}>^{-1} - <\\mathfrak{\\mathbf{B}}>]^{-1} <\\mathbf{r}>$$ {#eq-eq_soln}\n\nwhere $<  >$ is the expected value operator.\n\n",
