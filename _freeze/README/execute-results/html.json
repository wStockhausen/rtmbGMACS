RTMB ([R Bindings for Template Model Builder](https://github.com/kaskr/RTMB)) is \nan R package that provides a native R interface to Template Model Builder ([TMB](https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp)), an R package that allows the user to develop and run C++-based statistical models (similar to ADMB) using automatic differentiation in the R framework.\n\n## Installation\n\n**DON'T TRY THIS YET!!**\nYou can install the current (at present, development) version of rtmbGMACS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:\n\n``` r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"wStockhausen/rtmbGMACS\")\n```\n\n****************************\n\n## NOAA Disclaimer\n\nThis repository is a scientific product and is not an official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.

The ADMB version of GMACS \nis currently used to provide fishery stock assessment information to the \nNorth Pacific Fishery Management Council ([NPFMC](https://www.npfmc.org)) for a number \nof crab stocks in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (see, for example, the stock assessment \nreports for [Bristol Bay red king crab](https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=b98b90b2-88ab-43c2-9487-c12cdb4e0a25.pdf&fileName=BBRKC%20SAFE%202022%20Final.pdf) and [snow crab](https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=fca55335-ad34-4896-9b1e-4c09aa8342ce.pdf&fileName=EBS%20Snow%20SAFE%20FINAL.pdf)).\n\nHere, the RTMB model is referred to as \"gmacs\" while the R package is referred to \"rtmbGMACS\". The \n*R* package provides functions to set up data inputs to gmacs, with associated likelihood functions, \nselect functional forms for various population processes, \ndefine estimable parameters and associated priors or penalties, run the model, \ncreate plots and tables from a fitted model, and compare multiple models.\n\n## Software architecture\n\nThe rtmbGMACS *R* package allows \nthe user to construct a rather general size-structured population dynamics model, as well as \"observation\" models for \npredicting data values and associated likelihood functions to characterize model fit, define various characteristics \n(e.g., value, hyper parameters and prior probability function) of the resulting set of model parameters, calculate \nthe population state and predict observations through time based on the parameter values, and calculate individual and \ntotal likelihood components. \n\n\n\n",
