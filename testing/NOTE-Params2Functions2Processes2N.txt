test parameters -> functions -> process mapping -> model N vector

N(y,s) is a vector representing abundance in year y at the start of season s in each "realized""
combination of life stage category c1 x c2 x ...x cn, where the c's represent
different life stage catgories (e.g., sex, maturity state, size). The term "realized"
emphasizes that some specific combinations of life stage categories may be biologically or
physically impossible and would (could) thus be excluded from the model.

for each season s
N(y,s+1) = T(y,s) * N(t,s) + d(y,s)*r(y,s)
where T(y,s) is the complete model transition matrix for year y representing the
population processes occuring in season s, d(y,s) is an on/off switch (1 or 0) indicating
whether or not recruitment occurred in season s in year y,
and r(y,s) represents recruitment in year y, season s.

The initial abundance in season 1 of year y+1 is given by
N(y+1,s=1) = T(y,s=last) * N(y,s=last) + d(y,s=last)*r(y,s=last)

T(y,s) can be factored into several separable proceses, e.g.:
T(y,s) = M(y,s) * G(y,s) * m(y,s)
where
M represents mortality (natural + fishing) -- a diagonal matrix
G represents growth and maturation         -- a non-diagonal matrix (or I)
and m represents movement (a matrix).      -- a non-diagonal matrix (or I)

Depending on temporal variation, it may be possible to represent the T(y,s)'s (or,
more likely, the component separable processes)
by a much smaller number individual T_i's, say, where (y,s) maps to one of the
small number of i's. This mapping could be represented by a dataframe or matrix with columns
indicating y, s, i and a corresponding vector could indicate whether or not the ith
matrix had already been calculated (triggering calculation if not).

Calculating a T_i: see "NOTE-TransitionMatrixSetup.txt"

Consider a function f_i = f(v1_i,v2_i) where
v1 = SUM_i{}
