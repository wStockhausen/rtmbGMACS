## Model population dynamics {#sec-ModelPopDy}

The population state at any given time is represented here by the vector $n_c$, where *c* denotes the set of population categories (i.e., region, sex, maturity state, etc.) that characterizes the population. It is tracked in the code by the 1-dimensional vector  `n_c`, where `c` is a 1-dimensional index running over the combination of "user" population categories. The population state in year *y* at the beginning of season *s* is represented here by the 3-dimensional array $n_ysc$ and is tracked in the code using the 3-dimensional array `n_ysc`, indexed by `y`,`s`, and `c` indices.
